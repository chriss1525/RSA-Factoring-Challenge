#RSA FActoring Challenge

This project contains programs that;

- factorize a number as a product of two smaller numbers
- factorize a semiprime number into the product of two prime numbers

The RSA challenge involves breaking down large semiprimes into their constituent prime factors within the shortest time possible.
